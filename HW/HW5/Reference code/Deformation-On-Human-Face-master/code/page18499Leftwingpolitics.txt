The political terms ''Left'' and ''[[Right-wing politics|Right]]'' were coined during the [[French Revolution]] (1789–1799), referring to the seating arrangement in the [[French States-General|Estates General]]: those who sat on the left generally opposed the [[monarchy]] and supported the revolution, including the creation of a [[republic]] and [[secularization]],<ref name="Knapp"/> while those on the right were supportive of the traditional institutions of the [[Ancien Régime|Old Regime]]. Use of the term "Left" became more prominent after the restoration of the French monarchy in 1815 when it was applied to the "Independents".<ref>''Realms of memory: conflicts and divisions'' (1996), ed.

[[File:Estatesgeneral.jpg|left|thumb|5 May 1789: Opening of the Estates-General in Versailles]]
In politics, the term ''Left'' derives from the [[French Revolution]], as the anti-monarchist [[The Mountain|Montagnard]] and [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobin]] deputies from the [[Estates-General of 1789|Third Estate]] generally sat to the left of the presiding member's chair in parliament, a habit which began in the [[French States-General|Estates General]] of 1789. Throughout the [[France in the 19th century|19th century in France]], the main line dividing [[Politics of France|left and right]] was between supporters of the French [[Republic]] and those of the [[Monarchy]].<ref name="Knapp">{{cite book|last1=Knapp|first1=Andrew|last2=Wright|first2=Vincent|title=The government and politics of France|date=2006|publisher=Routledge|location=London [u.a.]|isbn=978-0-415-35732-6|edition=5th|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=67ttjXHhT3wC&dq=the+government+and+politics+of+france&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=&f=false}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=November 2016}} The [[June Days Uprising]] during the [[French Second Republic|Second Republic]] was an attempt by the Left to assert itself after the [[1848 Revolution (France)|1848 Revolution]], but only a small portion of the population supported this.

In the mid-19th century, [[nationalism]], [[socialism]], [[democracy]], and [[anti-clericalism]] became features of the French Left. After [[Napoleon III]]'s [[French coup of 1851|1851 coup]] and the subsequent establishment of the [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]], [[Marxism]] began to rival radical republicanism and [[utopian socialism]] as a force within left-wing politics. The influential ''[[Communist Manifesto]]'' by [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]], published in 1848, asserted that all human history is the history of [[class struggle]]. They predicted that a [[proletarian]] revolution would eventually overthrow [[bourgeois]] [[capitalism]] and create a [[classless]], [[Stateless society|stateless]], post-monetary [[communist society]]. It was in this period that the word "wing" was appended to both Left and Right.<ref name="oed.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/107000?redirectedFrom=left-wing#eid|title=Home : Oxford English Dictionary|work=oed.com}}</ref>

In the United States, many leftists, [[social liberal]]s, [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]]s and [[trade unionist]]s were influenced by the works of [[Thomas Paine]], who introduced the concept of [[asset-based egalitarianism]], which theorises that [[social equality]] is possible by a redistribution of resources.

The [[International Workingmen's Association]] (1864–76), sometimes called the First International, brought together delegates from many different countries, with many different views about how to reach a classless and stateless society. Following a split between supporters of Marx and [[Mikhail Bakunin]], anarchists formed the [[International Workers' Association]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Marshall |first=Peter |title=[[Demanding the Impossible]]&nbsp;&nbsp;— A History of Anarchism |page=9 |publisher=Fontana Press |location=London |year=1993 |isbn=978-0-00-686245-1}}</ref> The [[Second International]] (1888–1916) became divided over the issue of [[World War I]]. Those who opposed the war, such as [[Vladimir Lenin]] and [[Rosa Luxemburg]], saw themselves as further to the left.

==Positions==
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2016}}
The following positions are typically associated with left-wing politics.

===Economics===
Leftist economic beliefs range from [[Keynesian]] economics and the [[welfare state]] through [[industrial democracy]] and the [[social market]] to [[nationalization]] of the economy and [[Planned economy|central planning]],<ref>Andrew Glyn, ''Social Democracy in Neoliberal Times: The Left and Economic Policy since 1980'', Oxford University Press, 2001, ISBN 978-0-19-924138-5,</ref> to the [[anarcho-syndicalist]] advocacy of a council- and assembly-based self-managed [[anarchist communism]]. During the [[industrial revolution]], leftists supported [[trade union]]s. At the beginning of the 20th century, many leftists advocated strong government intervention in the economy.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Beinhocker|first1=Eric D.|title=The Origin of Wealth: Evolution, Complexity, and the Radical Remaking of Economics|date=2006|publisher=[[Harvard Business Press|Harvard Business School Press]]|location=Boston, Mass.|isbn=978-1-57851-777-0|page=316|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=eUoolrxSFy0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Beinhocker#PPA416,M1}}</ref> Leftists continue to criticize what they perceive as the exploitative nature of [[globalization]], the "[[race to the bottom]]", and unjust lay-offs. In the last quarter of the 20th century, the belief that government (ruling in accordance with the interests of the people) ought to be directly involved in the day-to-day workings of an economy declined in popularity amongst the [[center-left]], especially [[social democrat]]s who became influenced by "[[Third Way (centrism)|Third Way]]" ideology.

Other leftists believe in [[Marxian economics]], which are based on the economic theories of [[Karl Marx]]. Some distinguish Marx's economic theories from his political philosophy, arguing that Marx's approach to understanding the economy is independent of his advocacy of revolutionary [[socialism]] or his belief in the inevitability of [[proletariat|proletarian]] revolution.<ref>{{cite web

The "[[dictatorship of the proletariat]]" or "[[workers' state]]" are terms used by some Marxists, particularly [[Leninist]]s and [[Marxist–Leninist]]s, to describe what they see as a temporary state between the [[capitalist]] state of affairs and a [[communist society]]. Marx defined the proletariat as salaried workers, in contrast to the [[lumpenproletariat]], who he defined as outcasts of society, such as beggars, tricksters, entertainers, buskers, criminals, and prostitutes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9049344/Lumpenproletariat|title=Lumpenproletariat|work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}</ref> The political relevance of farmers has divided the left.

[[Left-libertarian]]s, [[libertarian socialist]]s, and [[anarchist]]s believe in a [[decentralized]] economy run by [[trade union]]s, [[workers' council]]s, [[cooperative]]s, [[Municipality|municipalities]], and [[Commune (socialism)|communes]], and oppose both [[State ownership|state]] and [[Private property|private]] control of the economy, preferring [[social ownership]] and local control, in which a nation of decentralized regions are united in a [[confederation]].

From the 1970s onwards, environmentalism became an increasing concern of the left, with social movements and some unions campaigning over environmental issues. For example, the left-wing [[Builders Labourers Federation]] in [[Australia]], led by the communist Jack Mundy, united with environmentalists to place [[Green Bans]] on environmentally destructive development projects.<ref>Meredith Burgman, Green Bans, Red Union: Environmental Activism and the New South Wales Builders Labourers' Federation (UNSW Press, Sydney,1998)</ref> Some segments of the socialist and Marxist left consciously merged environmentalism and anti-capitalism into an [[eco-socialist]] ideology.<ref>See for example, Wall, D., Babylon and Beyond: The Economics of Anti-Capitalist, Anti-Globalist and Radical Green Movements, 2005</ref> [[Barry Commoner]] articulated a left-wing response to [[The Limits to Growth]] model that predicted catastrophic resource depletion and spurred environmentalism, postulating that capitalist technologies were chiefly responsible for environmental degradation, as opposed to population pressures.<ref>Commoner, B., ''[[The Closing Circle]]'', 1972</ref> Environmental degradation can be seen as a class or equity issue, as environmental destruction disproportionately affects poorer communities and countries.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.blacksmithinstitute.org/articles/file/The+Argentimes.pdf | title=Poor Bear Burden of Industrialisation | work=[[Blacksmith Institute]] | date=19 October 2007 | accessdate=16 April 2016 | author=Sanra Ritten}}</ref>

Several left-wing or socialist groupings have an overt environmental concern, whereas several green parties contain a strong socialist presence. For example, the [[Green Party of England and Wales]] features an eco-socialist group, [[Green Left (UK)]], that was founded in June 2005 and whose members held a number of influential positions within the party, including both the former Principal Speakers [[Siân Berry]] and Dr. [[Derek Wall]], himself an eco-socialist and marxist academic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gptu.net/gleft/greenleft.shtml |title=Green Left homepage |publisher=Gptu.net |date= |accessdate=13 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090311004501/http://gptu.net/gleft/greenleft.shtml |archivedate=11 March 2009 }}</ref> In Europe, some "[[Green Left (disambiguation)|Green-Left]]" political parties combine traditional social-democratic values such as a desire for greater economic equality and workers rights with demands for environmental protection, such as the [[European United Left–Nordic Green Left|Nordic Green Left]].

===Nationalism and anti-nationalism===
{{refimprove section|date=November 2012}}
{{See also|Internationalism (politics)|Left-wing nationalism|Proletarian internationalism}}
The question of [[nationality]] and [[nationalism]] has been a central feature of political debates on the Left. During the French Revolution, nationalism was a policy of the Republican Left.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Doyle|first1=William|title=The Oxford History of the French Revolution|date=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-925298-5|edition=2nd|quote= "An exuberant, uncompromising nationalism lay behind France's revolutionary expansion in the 1790s...", "The message of the French Revolution was that the people are sovereign; and in the two centuries since it was first proclaimed it has conquered the world."}}</ref> The Republican Left advocated [[civic nationalism]],<ref name="Knapp"/> and argued that the nation is a "daily plebiscite" formed by the subjective "will to live together."  Related to "revanchism", the belligerent will to take revenge against Germany and retake control of [[Alsace-Lorraine]], nationalism was sometimes opposed to [[imperialism]]. In the 1880s, there was a debate between those, such as [[Georges Clemenceau]] (Radical), [[Jean Jaurès]] (Socialist) and [[Maurice Barrès]] (nationalist), who argued that colonialism diverted France from the "blue line of the [[Vosges mountains|Vosges]]" (referring to Alsace-Lorraine), and the "[[French colonial empire|colonial lobby]]", such as Jules Ferry (moderate republican), Léon Gambetta (republican) and [[Eugène Etienne]], the president of the parliamentary colonial group. After the [[Dreyfus Affair]] however nationalism became increasingly associated with the far right.<ref>[[Michel Winock|Winock, Michel]] (dir.), ''Histoire de l'extrême droite en France'' (1993)</ref>

The [[Marxist]] [[social class]] theory of [[proletarian internationalism]] asserts that members of the [[working class]] should act in solidarity with working people in other countries in pursuit of a common [[class interest]], rather than focusing on their own countries. Proletarian internationalism is summed up in the slogan, "[[Workers of all countries, unite!]]", the last line of ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]''. Union members had learned that more members meant more bargaining power. Taken to an international level, leftists argued that workers ought to act in solidarity to further increase the power of the working class.

Proletarian internationalism saw itself as a deterrent against war, because people with a common interest are less likely to take up arms against one another, instead focusing on fighting the [[ruling class]]. According to Marxist theory, the [[antonym]] of proletarian internationalism is [[bourgeois nationalism]]. Some Marxists, together with others on the left, view [[nationalism]],<ref>Szporluk, Roman. Communism and Nationalism. 2nd. Oxford University Press, 1991.</ref> [[racism]]<ref>{{cite journal |first=John |last=Solomos |first2=Les |last2=Back |title=Marxism, Racism, and Ethnicity |journal=American Behavioral Scientist |year=1995 |volume=38 |issue=3 |pages=407–420 |doi=10.1177/0002764295038003004}}</ref> (including [[anti-Semitism]]<ref>{{cite web |last=Lenin |first=Vladimir |title=Anti-Jewish Pogroms |work=Speeches On Gramophone Records |publisher= |year=1919 |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1919/mar/x10.htm}}</ref>), and [[religion]], as [[Divide and rule|divide and conquer]] tactics used by the ruling classes to prevent the [[working class]] from uniting against them. Left-wing movements therefore have often taken up [[anti-imperialism|anti-imperialist]] positions. Anarchism has developed a [[Anarchism and nationalism|critique of nationalism]] that focuses on nationalism's role in justifying and consolidating state power and domination. Through its unifying goal, nationalism strives for centralization, both in specific territories and in a ruling elite of individuals, while it prepares a population for capitalist exploitation. Within anarchism, this subject has been treated extensively by [[Rudolf Rocker]] in ''[[Nationalism and Culture]]'' and by the works of [[Fredy Perlman]], such as ''[[Against His-Story, Against Leviathan]]'' and "The Continuing Appeal of Nationalism".<ref>{{cite book |title=The Continuing Appeal of Nationalism |first=Fredy |last=Perlman |location=Detroit |publisher=Black & Red |year=1985 |isbn=0317295586}}</ref>

The failure of revolutions in [[German Revolution|Germany]] and [[Hungarian Soviet Republic|Hungary]] ended [[Bolshevik]] hopes for an imminent [[world revolution]] and led to promotion of "[[Socialism in One Country]]" by [[Joseph Stalin]]. In the first edition of the book ''Osnovy Leninizma'' (''Foundations of Leninism'', 1924), Stalin argued that revolution in one country is insufficient. But by the end of that year, in the second edition of the book, he argued that the "[[proletariat]] can and must build the socialist society in one country". In April 1925 [[Nikolai Bukharin]] elaborated the issue in his brochure ''Can We Build Socialism in One Country in the Absence of the Victory of the West-European Proletariat?'' The position was adopted as State policy after Stalin's January 1926 article ''On the Issues of Leninism'' (К вопросам ленинизма). This idea was opposed by [[Leon Trotsky]] and his followers who declared the need for an international "[[permanent revolution]]". Various Fourth Internationalist groups around the world who describe themselves as Trotskyist see themselves as standing in this tradition, while [[Maoist China]] supported Socialism in One Country.

European social-democrats strongly support [[Europeanism]] and [[supranational]] integration, although there is a minority of nationalists and eurosceptics also in the left. Some link this [[left-wing nationalism]] to the pressure generated by economic integration with other countries encouraged by [[free-trade]] agreements. This view is sometimes used to justify hostility towards supranational organizations. Left-wing nationalism can also refer to any nationalism which emphasises a working-class populist agenda which seeks to overcome perceived exploitation or oppression by other nations. Many [[Third World]] anti-colonial movements adopted left-wing and socialist ideas.

[[Third-Worldism]] is a tendency within leftist thought that regards the division between [[First World]] [[developed country|developed countries]] and [[Third World]] [[developing countries]] as being of high political importance. This tendency supports [[decolonization|national liberation movements]] against what it considers [[imperialism]] by capitalists. Third-Worldism is closely connected with [[African socialism]], [[Socialism#Latin America|Latin American socialism]], [[Maoism]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://anti-imperialism.com/2012/11/02/what-is-maoism-third-worldism/|title=What is Maoism-Third Worldism?|work=Anti-Imperialism.com}}</ref>{{third-party-inline|date=November 2012}} [[Pan-Africanism]] and [[Pan-Arabism]]. Some left-wing groups in the developing world — such as the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation]] in Mexico, the [[Abahlali baseMjondolo]] in [[South Africa]] and the [[Naxalites]] in India — argue that the First World Left takes a racist and paternalistic attitude towards liberation movements in the Third World.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}

===Religion===
{{See also|Anarchism and religion|Christian left}}
The original French left-wing was [[anti-clerical]], opposing the influence of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and supporting the [[separation of church and state]].<ref name="Knapp"/> [[Karl Marx]] asserted that "Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the [[opium of the people]]."<ref>Marx, K. 1976. ''Introduction to A Contribution to the Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right''. Collected Works, v. 3. New York.</ref> In Soviet Russia the [[Bolshevik]]s originally embraced "an ideological creed which professed that all religion would atrophy" and "resolved to eradicate [[Christianity]] as such." In 1918 "ten [[Russian Orthodox|Orthodox]] hierarchs were summarily shot" and "children were deprived of any religious education outside the home."<ref>[[Michael Burleigh]] ''Sacred Causes'' HarperCollins (2006) p41-43</ref> Today in the [[Western world]], those on the Left usually support [[secularization]] and the [[separation of church and state]].

Religious beliefs, however, have also been associated with some left-wing movements, such as the [[civil rights movement]] and the anti-[[capital punishment]] movement. Early [[socialist]] thinkers such as [[Robert Owen]], [[Charles Fourier]], and the [[Comte de Saint-Simon]] based their theories of socialism upon Christian principles. From [[St. Augustine of Hippo]]'s ''[[City of God (book)|City of God]]'' through [[St. Thomas More]]'s ''[[Utopia]]'' major Christian writers defended ideas that socialists found agreeable.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Other common leftist concerns such as [[pacifism]], [[social justice]], [[racial equality]], [[human rights]], and the rejection of excessive [[wealth]] can be found in the [[Bible]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,1533448,00.html |title=Does God Want You To Be Rich? |publisher=''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' |author=David van Biema, Jeff Chu |date=10 September 2006 |accessdate=20 April 2011}}</ref> In the late 19th century, the [[Social Gospel]] movement arose (particularly among some [[Anglo-Catholicism|Anglicans]], [[Lutheran]]s, [[Methodist]]s and [[Baptist]]s in [[North America]] and [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]]) which attempted to integrate [[progressivism|progressive]] and [[socialist]] thought with [[Christianity]] in faith-based social activism, promoted by movements such as [[Christian Socialism]]. In the 20th century, [[liberation theology|the theology of liberation]] and [[Creation Spirituality]] was championed by such writers as [[Gustavo Gutierrez]] and [[Matthew Fox (priest)|Matthew Fox]].

Other left-wing religious movements include [[Islamic socialism]] and [[Buddhist socialism]]. There have been alliances between the Left and anti-war [[Muslim]]s, such as the [[Respect Party]] and the [[Stop the War Coalition]] in Britain. In France, the Left has been divided over moves to ban the [[hijab]] from schools, with some supporting a ban based on separation of church and state, and others opposing the ban based on personal freedom.

===Social progressivism and counterculture===
{{See also|Socialist feminism|Socialism and LGBT rights}}
[[Social progressivism]] is another common feature of modern leftism, particularly in the United States, where social progressives played an important role in the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolition of slavery]],<ref>James Brewer Stewrt, ''Abolitionist Politics and the Coming of the Civil War'', [[University of Massachusetts Press]], 2008, ISBN 978-1-55849-635-4.  "...the progressive assumptions of 'uplift'." (page 40)</ref> [[women's suffrage]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/learn/features/timeline/progress/suffrage/suffrage.html |title=For Teachers (Library of Congress) |publisher=Lcweb2.loc.gov |date= |accessdate=13 May 2010}}</ref> [[civil rights]], and [[multiculturalism]]. Progressives have both advocated [[prohibition]] legislation and worked towards its repeal. Current positions associated with social progressivism in [[Western world|the West]] include opposition to the [[death penalty]] and the [[War on Drugs]], and support for legal recognition of [[same-sex marriage]], [[cognitive liberty]], distribution of [[contraceptive]]s, public funding of embryonic [[stem-cell research]], and the right of women to choose [[abortion]]. Public education was a subject of great interest to groundbreaking social progressives such as [[Lester Frank Ward]] and [[John Dewey]] who believed that a democratic system of government was impossible without a universal and comprehensive system of education.

Various [[counterculture]] movements in the 1960s and 1970s were associated with the "[[New Left]]". Unlike the earlier leftist focus on [[labour movement|union]] activism, the "New Left" instead adopted a broader definition of political activism commonly called [[social activism]]. The US "New Left" is associated with the [[Hippie|Hippie movement]], college campus mass protest movements and a broadening of focus from protesting [[social class|class]]-based oppression to include issues such as [[gender]], [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], and [[sexual orientation]]. The British "New Left" was an intellectually driven movement which attempted to correct the perceived errors of "Old Left".

The New Left opposed prevailing authority structures in society, which it termed "The Establishment", and became known as "anti-Establishment." The New Left did not seek to recruit industrial workers, but rather concentrated on a [[social activist]] approach to organization, convinced that they could be the source for a better kind of [[social revolution]]. This view has been criticised by some [[Marxist]]s (especially [[Trotskyist]]s) who characterized this approach as "substitutionism", which was what they saw as the misguided and non-Marxist belief that other groups in society could "substitute" for the revolutionary agency of the working class.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1960/xx/trotsub.htm |title=Tony Cliff: Trotsky on substitutionism (Autumn 1960) |publisher=Marxists.org |date= |accessdate=13 May 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scribd.com/doc/4662049/Against-Substitutionism |title=Against Substitutionism |publisher=Scribd.com |date=6 November 2006 |accessdate=13 May 2010}}</ref>

Many early [[feminist]]s and advocates of [[women's rights]] were considered left-wing by their contemporaries. Feminist pioneer [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] was influenced by the radical thinker [[Thomas Paine]]. Many notable leftists have been strong supporters of gender equality, such as: the Marxists [[Rosa Luxemburg]], [[Clara Zetkin]], and [[Alexandra Kollontai]]; anarchists such as [[Virginia Bolten]], [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Lucía Sánchez Saornil]]; and the socialists [[Helen Keller]] and [[Annie Besant]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Campling|first1=Valerie Bryson.

Marxists were responsible for organizing the first [[International Working Women's Day]] events.<ref>{{cite web|author=Alexandra Kollontai |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/kollonta/1920/womens-day.htm |title=1920-Inter Women's Day |publisher=Marxists.org |date=26 August 1920 |accessdate=13 May 2010}}</ref>

The [[women's liberation movement]] is closely connected to the New Left and other [[new social movements]] that challenged the orthodoxies of the Old Left. [[Socialist feminism]], as exemplified by the [[Freedom Socialist Party]] and [[Radical Women]]; and [[Marxist feminism]], as with [[Selma James]], saw themselves as a part of the left that challenged what they perceive to be male-dominated and [[sexist]] structures within the left. [[Liberal feminism]] is closely connected with [[social liberalism]], and the left wing of mainstream American politics (e.g., [[National Organization for Women]]).

The connection between left-leaning ideologies and [[LGBT rights]] struggles also has an important history. Prominent socialists who were involved in early struggles for LGBT rights include [[Edward Carpenter]], [[Oscar Wilde]], [[Harry Hay]], [[Bayard Rustin]], and [[Daniel Guérin]] among others.

==Varieties==
The spectrum of left-wing politics ranges from [[center-left]] to [[far-left]] (or [[ultra-left]]). The term ''center-left'' describes a position within the political mainstream. The terms ''far-left'' and ''ultra-left'' refer to positions that are more [[Political radicalism|radical]]. The center-left includes [[Social democracy|social democrat]]s, [[social liberal]]s, [[Progressivism|progressive]]s and also some [[democratic socialist]]s and [[Green politics|greens]] (including some [[eco-socialist]]s). Center-left supporters accept market allocation of resources in a [[mixed economy]] with a significant [[public sector]] and a thriving [[private sector]]. Center-left policies tend to favour limited state intervention in matters pertaining to the [[public interest]].

In several countries, the terms ''far-left'' and ''radical left'' have been associated with varieties of [[communism]], [[autonomism]], and [[anarchism]]. They have been used to describe groups that advocate [[anti-capitalism]] or [[eco-terrorism]]. In France, a distinction is made between the ''left'' ([[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]] and [[French Communist Party|Communist Party]]) and the ''far-left'' ([[Trotskyist]]s, [[Maoist]]s, and [[anarchist]]s).<ref>Cosseron, Serge (ed.). ''Le dictionnaire de l'extrême gauche''. Paris: [[Éditions Larousse|Larousse]], 2007. p. 20</ref> The US [[Department of Homeland Security]] defines left-wing extremism as groups that want "to bring about change through violent revolution rather than through established political processes".<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090419052505/http://theplumline.whorunsgov.com:80/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/hsa-leftwing-extremists-increase-in-cyber-attacks-dated-26-january-2009.pdf ]</ref>

In China, the term "[[Chinese New Left]]" denotes those who oppose the current [[Economic reform in the People's Republic of China|economic reforms]] and favour the restoration of more socialist policies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.ft.com/cms/s/74029202-a389-11da-83cc-0000779e2340,s01=1.html|title=China launches 'New Deal' for farmers|publisher=[[Financial Times]]|date=22 February 2006}}</ref> In the [[Western world]], the term ''[[New Left]]'' refers to cultural politics. In the [[United Kingdom]] in the 1980s, the term "[[hard left]]" was applied to supporters of [[Tony Benn]], such as the [[Campaign Group]] and those involved in the ''[[Labour Briefing|London Labour Briefing]]'' newspaper, as well as Trotskyist groups such as [[Militant (Trotskyist group)|Militant]] and the [[Alliance for Workers' Liberty]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/1054337.stm | work=BBC News | title=Benn's golden anniversary | date=4 December 2000 | accessdate=4 April 2010}}</ref> In the same period, the term "[[soft left]]" was applied to supporters of the [[British Labour Party]] who were perceived to be more moderate. Under the leadership of [[Tony Blair]] and [[Gordon Brown]], the British Labour Party rebranded itself as [[New Labour]] in order to promote the notion that it was less left-wing than it had been in the past. One of the first actions of the Labour Party leader who succeeded them, [[Ed Miliband]], was the rejection of the "New Labour" label. However, Labour's voting record in parliament would indicate that it had, under Miliband, maintained the same distance from the left as it had with Blair.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-26743802 | work=BBC News | title=MPs approve annual welfare cap in Commons vote | date=26 March 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=John Kampfner |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/nov/05/labour-back-on-the-right |title=Labour's return to the right &#124; John Kampfner &#124; Opinion |publisher=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=15 November 2016}}</ref> Likewise, the election of [[Jeremy Corbyn]] as Labour Party leader was viewed by some as Labour turning back toward its socialist roots.

Leftist [[postmodernism]] opposes attempts to supply universal explanatory theories, including Marxism, deriding them as [[Meta-narrative|grand narratives]]. It views culture as a contested space, and via [[deconstruction]] seeks to undermine all pretensions to absolute truth. Left-wing critics of post-modernism assert that [[cultural studies]] inflates the importance of culture by denying the existence of an independent reality.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20051125104930/http://www.isj.org.uk:80/index.php4?id=59issue=105 ]</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20030421013324/http://cscs.umich.edu:80/~crshalizi/chomsky-on-postmodernism.html ]  {{Dead link|date=November 2016}}</ref>

In 1996, [[physicist]] [[Alan Sokal]] wrote [[Sokal Affair|a nonsensical article]] entitled "Transgressing the Boundaries: Toward a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.physics.nyu.edu/sokal/transgress_v2/transgress_v2_singlefile.html |title=Transgressing the Boundaries: Toward a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity |publisher=Physics.nyu.edu |date= |accessdate=15 November 2016}}</ref> The journal ''[[Social Text]]'' published the paper in its Spring/Summer 1996 issue, whereupon Sokal publicly revealed his hoax. While this action was interpreted as an attack upon leftism, Sokal, who was a committed supporter of the [[Sandinista]] movement in [[Nicaragua]] during the 1980s, intended it as a critique from within the left.<ref name="physics.nyu.edu">{{cite web|url=http://www.physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/lingua_franca_v4/lingua_franca_v4.html|title=A Physicist Experiments With Cultural Studies|work=physics.nyu.edu|author=Alan D. Sokal}}</ref> He said he was concerned about what he saw as the increasing prevalence on the left of "a particular kind of nonsense and sloppy thinking [...] that denies the existence of objective realities". He called into question the usefulness of such theories to the wider left movement, saying he "never understood how [[deconstruction]] was meant to help the working class".<ref name="physics.nyu.edu"/>{{Relevance inline|date=March 2017}}
